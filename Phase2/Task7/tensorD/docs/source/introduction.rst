*TensorD*: A Tensor Decomposition Library in Tensorflow

*TensorD* is a tensor decomposition library built on TensorFlow.
It provides basic decomposition methods, such as Tucker
decomposition and CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition,
as well as new decomposition methods developed recently,
for example, Pairwise Interaction Tensor Decomposition.
Except these utilities, other features of *TensorD}*
include that its internal functions all use the interface
provided by Tensorflow, and it can be embedded directly
into Tensorflow-based codes when needed.
